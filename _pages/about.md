Hi there! I'm a third year PhD student in the department of [Statistics](https://stat.wisc.edu) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://wisc.edu), working with Professor [Kirthevasan Kandasamy](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~kandasamy/index.html). Prior to coming to UW-Madison, I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mathematics and Statistics at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu) and worked as a Data Scientist in the Consumer Insights and Analytics department at [Lehigh Valley Health Network](https://www.lvhn.org/).

I'm also currently working as a Statistical Consultant with the [Statistical Consulting Group](https://stat.wisc.edu/statistical-consulting/) at UW-Madison. I provide assistance to clients in a variety of fields such as Plant Pathology, Soil Science, Food Science, and Biochemistry, among others, on various aspects of the research process including, but not limited to, experimental design, data analysis and visualization, manuscript preparation, and responding to reviewer comments during the peer review process.

Research
======

My work primarily focuses on aligning the theory and design of machine learning models with practical incentives in the real world. I'm currently focusing on applications in sequential decision making, mechanism design, and multi-source learning. I'm always happy to "talk shop," so if any of this interests you, or you want to chat about any other related topics, please don't hesitate to reach out!
