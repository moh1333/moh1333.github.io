Hi there! I'm a third year PhD student in the department of [Statistics](https://stat.wisc.edu) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://wisc.edu), working with Professor [Kirthi Kandasamy](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~kandasamy/index.html). Prior to coming to UW-Madison, I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mathematics and Statistics at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu) and worked as a Data Scientist in the Consumer Insights and Analytics department at [Lehigh Valley Health Network](https://www.lvhn.org/).

Research
======
My work primarily focuses on aligning the theory and design of machine learning models with practical incentives in the real world. I'm currently focusing on applications in sequential decision making, mechanism design, and multi-source learning. I'm always happy to "talk shop," so if any of this interests you, or you want to chat about any other related topics, please feel free to reach out!
